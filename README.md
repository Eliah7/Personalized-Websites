# Personalized-Websites

## Inroduction
It is always the dream for great UX designers to create websites and applications that appear and respond differently to different users based on who is using the website. This is known as personalized application design.

This project aims to transform that dream into a reality. 

## TensorFlow.js to the resque
I have always wanted to implement this idea, and I also have known that using ML and deeplearning tools is a must. 
This would be insecure since user data would be  transferred to the server, also the responce time for the applications would be really slow.

Tensorflow.js realeased for web applications solves this problem well for me, now I can begin developing.
